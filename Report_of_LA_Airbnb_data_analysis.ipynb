        "- **Challenge**: Variables such as neighborhoods and property types contained too many small categories.\n",
        "- **Solution**:\n",
        "  - For columns such as `property_type`. Consolidated small categories using domain knowledge or retained only the top N categories by frequency.Then one-hot encode the categorical data.\n",
        "  - Applied frequency encoding to improve model performance, especially for the `neighborhood_cleansed` variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Text Features\n",
        "- **Analysis**: Extracted basic text attributes such as word count and frequency from columns like `description`.\n",
        "- **Hypothesis**: Listings with higher word counts in their descriptions tend to be of higher quality and have higher prices.\n",
        "\n",

        "- **Normalization**: Standardized numerical columns to ensure uniformity across features.\n",
        "- **Missing Values**: Filled missing values with column means to maintain dataset integrity.\n",
        "- **Target Variable (`price`)**:\n",
        "  - Observed high skewness in the price distribution using histograms.\n",
        "  - Applied log transformation to normalize the target variable, which improved model performance.\n",
